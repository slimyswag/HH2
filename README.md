I decided to make a game that will help raise awareness for pollution and ways to help prevent it. In this game there are 6 rounds with different kinds of pollution "enemies" where the user is prompted to use an attack to try and eliminated the pollution using real world ways they can limit pollution. I believe that this is a simple and fun way to show how easy it is to fight climate change and pollution. When inputting choices in the game, make sure to use proper capitalization and DO NOT use spaces.
